# Translations

## Localization

[Current Status](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/setvisible/ArrowDL/blob/master/.tx/status.html)


## Add a new translation

To add the language 'xx' in country 'XX':

1. Sign in Transifex

2. Go to Transifex > Language > Add the language > Add xx_XX

https://app.transifex.com/arrowdl/arrowdl/languages/


3. Add following line to `qt_add_translations(...)` in `./src/CMakeLists.txt`:
        
        ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/src/locale/arrowdl_xx_XX.ts
        
4. Add following line to `lang_map` in the Transifex config file `./.tx/config`:

        [arrowdl.main-application]
        ...
        lang_map = ... xx_XX: xx_XX
        ...

        [arrowdl.web-extension]
        ...
        lang_map = ... xx_XX: xx         < Note 'xx', not 'xx_XX'
        ...

        [arrowdl.windows-installer]
        ...
        lang_map = ... xx_XX: xx
        ...

5. 'Pull' with TX.exe (transifex client)

        tx pull --all
    Or
        .\tx.exe pull -a

    The first time, there should be warnings like:

        tx INFO: Pulling new translations for resource arrowdl.main-application
        tx WARNING:  -> <xx_XX>: src\locale\arrowdl_<xx_XX>.ts
        tx INFO: New translations found for the following languages:<xx_XX>

6. Translate (eventually)

7. To recreate the *.ts, run:

        `cmake.exe --build . --target update_translations`
        (previously: `lupdate ./src/src.pro -noobsolete`)

8. To generate the *.qm, run:

        `cmake.exe --build . --target release_translations`
        (previously: `lrelease ./src/src.pro`)

9. 'Push' the source file and translation files to the server with TX.exe (transifex client)

        tx push --source --translations --skip
    Or
        .\tx.exe push -st --skip

    Rem: '--skip' is useful when the file has not been translated yet. indeed, empty .ts returns a server error.

10. To recreate the *.nsh (NSIS), type: 

    `cd <REPO>/installer/windows/NSIS/i18n`
    `python.exe ./json2nsh.py`

11. Add the language in `<REPO>/installer/windows/NSIS/setup.nsi`:

    `!insertmacro LOAD_LANGUAGE XXX`

12. That's it. Follow instructions in next sections to update, build and release it.


## Translators Corner

If you are interested in translating this application to another language,
you can use the **Transifex** translation service, or the tool **Qt Linguist**.

### Online Translation

This method requires a **Transifex** user account.

1. Log on your account and go to the [project's page](https://www.transifex.com/arrowdl)

2. Edit the translations

Once 100% finished and verified, Transfex pushes the modifications automatically.
A merge into `develop` is however manually required.

(the updated translations should be available for the next release)

Note that unfinished translations may also be deployed from time to time.


### Offline Translation

This method requires:
- [Qt Framework](https://www.qt.io/)
- local clone of the repository

These files are the translations source (*.ts):

    <REPO>/src/locale/arrowdl_en_US.ts
    <REPO>/src/locale/arrowdl_fr_Fr.ts
    ...
    <REPO>/src/locale/arrowdl_zn_CN.ts


Use **Qt Linguist** to edit them.

Then, push the modifications, merge into `develop`,
and follow the classic deployment workflow.

_Rem:_ The advantage of this method over the online method is that the tool
shows the modifications in context within the app's UI, so it's more
confortable to watch what you get and correct the strings, positions,
lengths and other specific problems for a given language.


## Note for Developers

### 1. Qt

Translation files can be desynchronized after an update of the C++ source code.

To resynchronize *.ts with the source code, use `lupdate` and `lrelease`:

    `cmake.exe --build . --target update_translations`
    (previously: `lupdate <REPO>/src/src.pro -noobsolete`)

Then the *.ts files are synchronized with the C++ code.


### 2. (Optional) Transifex

Use the TX Client to push and pull translations to and from Transifex:

[Download the Transifex Client](https://github.com/transifex/cli/releases/latest/)

> You need `tx` (see Transifex documentation to [install](https://docs.transifex.com/client/installing-the-client) it)


#### Push

When youâ€™re ready to push your updated files to Transifex, use the `tx push` command.
The `-s` flag pushes source files, while the `-t` flag pushes translation files:

    $ tx push -st
    Pushing translations for resource i18n.enjson:
    Pushing source file (src/locale/arrowdl_en_US.ts)
    Pushing 'de_DE' translations (file: src/locale/arrowdl_de_DE.ts)
    Pushing 'es_ES' translations (file: src/locale/arrowdl_es_ES.ts)
    Done.


#### Pull

To pull changes into your local project folder, use `tx pull`:

    $ tx pull -a
    New translations found for the following languages: de, es
    Pulling new translations for resource i18n.enjson (source: src/locale/arrowdl_en_US.ts)
     -> de_DE: src/locale/arrowdl_de_DE.ts
     -> es_ES: src/locale/arrowdl_es_ES.ts
    Done.

At this point, *.ts files are synchronized with Transifex.


### 3. Build .qm from .ts

Before deploying, type:

    `cmake.exe --build . --target release_translations`
    (previously: `lrelease <REPO>/src/src.pro`)


It generates *.qm (compiled translation files) to be deployed with the application.
